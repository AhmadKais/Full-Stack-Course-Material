# 🌐 HTML Learning Project — "Personal Website Example"

Welcome to the **HTML Learning Project**!  
This project is designed to help you **learn and practice every major HTML tag** through a single, complete example — a personal website.

---

## 📘 Overview

The file [`index.html`](index.html) contains a **fully structured HTML5 webpage** that demonstrates:

- Semantic structure (header, main, footer, etc.)
- Text formatting and emphasis tags
- Lists, tables, forms, and media
- Modern HTML5 elements such as `<video>`, `<audio>`, `<progress>`, `<meter>`, and `<time>`
- Metadata, SEO, and accessibility best practices

This is an **educational playground** — you are encouraged to modify it freely, add your own content, and experiment with HTML elements.
